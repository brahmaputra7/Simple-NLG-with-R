Data obtained from weather monitoring stations and air quality acquired from
several meteorological websites are numerical data. The research is aimed at
developing a weather-generating Data to Text (D2T) that enables people to
understand weather and air quality information. On developing D2T, there are
four basic elements: signal analysis, data interpretation, document planning, as
well as microplanning and realization. This research contributes to extending the
signal analysis by adding new features: exponential smoothing for prediction
time series data, a linear model with gradient descent for handling missing values
and data summarization with statistical tools. In this study, several packages
available in the R programming language were utilized. To validate the results,
four measuring tools consisting of readability, computation time, relevance and
truthfulness and comprehensibility and importance were used. After evaluating
the results, it was stated that on the readability aspect the developed system can
be understood by students at the age of 13-15 years; computational time is low
(round 2.64 s) and sufficient scores for relevance and truthfulness and
comprehensibility and importance were obtained. Therefore, the proposed
system can be used to generate text for describing weather news and air quality.
